`pls` is a prettier and powerful `ls` for the pros.

The "p" stands for
- pretty (the output from `pls` surely looks better)
- powerful (`pls` has lots of features and endless customisation)
- programmer (`pls` is geared towards developers)
- professional (`pls` can be extensively tweaked by the pros)
- Python (`pls` is written in Python!)

Just pick whichever helps you remember the command name.

It works in a manner similar to `ls`, in  that it lists directories and files in
a given directory, but it adds many more
[developer-friendly features](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/features/summary.html).

> ⚠️ Note that `pls` is not a replacement for `ls`. `ls` is a tried, tested and
trusted command with lots of features. `pls`, on the other hand, is a simple
tool for people who just want to see the contents of their directories.
