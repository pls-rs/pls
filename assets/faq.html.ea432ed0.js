IDEs do all sorts of optimisations to help you see your files clearly and find them faster. <code>ls</code> does none of these.</p><p><code>pls</code> aims to be the closest thing to an IDE-like file panel inside a terminal.</p><h2 id="does-pls-support-windows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#does-pls-support-windows" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Does <code>pls</code> support Windows?</h2><p><strong>Yes</strong>, with caveats.</p><p><code>pls</code> runs on Windows with a reduced feature set but that is largely a result of Windows being an inferior operating-system.
