import { Content as ColorsOn } from "@/examples/colors/on.mdx";
import { Content as ColorsOff } from "@/examples/colors/off.mdx";

<Pls /> makes a lot of use of colors throughout the output. This makes it very
easy to grok the output and also makes it look pretty.

## Environment

By default <Pls /> will display colors if the terminal supports it and will
disable colors if the output is being piped to another command.

<Pls /> also respects the `NOCOLOR` and `CLICOLOR_FORCE` environment variables
that can be used forcefully disable or enable colors respectively.

:::caution

Turning off colors also turns off other ANSI-based styling such as bold, italic
underlines etc.

:::

### Examples

```bash
env NOCOLOR=true pls # or pls | cat
```

<ColorsOff />

```bash
pls # or env CLICOLOR_FORCE=true pls | cat
```

<ColorsOn />
