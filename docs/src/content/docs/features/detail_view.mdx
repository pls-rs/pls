<Pls /> can stat the nodes to derive more information, called metadata, about
them, which it can then present in a tabular format. This is called the detail
view.

## Arguments

`--det`/`-d` can be used to select the detail columns the user wants to see, and
indirectly turn the detail view on or off. The detail view is considered to be
turned off if no detail field is chosen.

The `--det`/`-d` flag can be specified multiple times to enable multiple fields.
Each time it can take one of these values.

| Value    | Description                                | Standard |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |

| `git`    | Git status                                 |          |
| `none`   | **shorthand:** no details                  |          |
| `std`    | **shorthand:** the standard set of details |          |
| `all`    | **shorthand:** all details                 |          |

The column headers for the detail view can be toggled using the
[`--header`/`-H` flag](/features/header/).

:::caution

Note that the detail view is incompatible with the
[grid view](/features/grid_view/). In case of conflict, the detail view will be
used and the grid view will be turned off.

### Mechanism

When parsing the `--det`/`-d` argument, values are read from the CLI, in order,
and added to a vector of fields till we encounter a shorthand value. If the
shorthand value is `none`, the vector is cleared. The other two shorthands are
expanded and added to the vector.

- `std` can be used to show the fields shown by `ls(1)` with the `-l` flag
- `all` can be used to show every available metadata field

For example, consider the <Pls /> invocation below.

```bash
pls --det=dev --det=ino --det=none --det=std --det=git
```

- `dev` is added to the list.
- `ino` is added to the list.
- All entries so far are dropped when `none` is encountered.
- `nlink`, `typ`, `perm`, `user`, `group`, `size` and `mtime` are added to the
  list when `std` is encountered
- `git` is added to the list.

The final set is thus `nlink`, `typ`, `perm`, `user`, `group`, `size`, `mtime`
and `git`. Since this is more than zero, <Pls /> will activate the detail view.

### Examples

```bash
pls # or --det=none or -d=none
```

<DetailViewNone />

```bash
pls --det=user --det=group # or -d=user -d=group
```

<DetailViewSel />

```bash
pls --det=std # or -d=std
```

<DetailViewStd />

```bash
pls --det=all # or -d=all
```

<DetailViewAll />

## Configuration

Each of the detail fields is deeply customisable. Read on to know more the
customisation options supported by each field.

### Fields

#### `dev` - Device ID

This field can by styled by specifying `entry_const.dev_style`. <Pls /> does not
style this field by default, because a style would not add any meaning.

#### `ino` - Inode number

This field can by styled by specifying `entry_const.ino_style`. <Pls /> does not
style this field by default, because a style would not add any meaning.

#### `nlink` - Number of hard links

This field can be styled different based on the type of the node and the number
of hard links the node has. <Pls /> allows files with more than one hard link
and directories with only one hard link to be styled differently because these
are peculiar cases. The opposite scenario is more common.

| Type | `nlink` | Style                                |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| file | 1       | `entry_const.nlink_styles.file_sing` |
| file | >1      | `entry_const.nlink_styles.file_plur` |
| dir  | 1       | `entry_const.nlink_styles.dir_sing`  |
| dir  | >1      | `entry_const.nlink_styles.dir_plur`  |

#### `typ` - Node type character

<Pls /> allows you to completely change the type character to whatever makes you
think of the node's type.

| Type         | Character                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Dir          | `entry_const.typ.dir.ch`          |
| Symlink      | `entry_const.typ.symlink.ch`      |
| FIFO         | `entry_const.typ.fifo.ch`         |
| Socket       | `entry_const.typ.socket.ch`       |
| Block device | `entry_const.typ.block_device.ch` |
| Char device  | `entry_const.typ.char_device.ch`  |
| File         | `entry_const.typ.file.ch`         |
| Unknown      | `entry_const.typ.unknown.ch`      |

#### `perm` - Symbolic permissions

This field can by styled by specifying `entry_const.perm_style`. <Pls /> allows
individual customisation of each of the permission characters for read (`r`),
write (`w`), execute (`x`), special (`s`/`S`/`t`/`T`) and none (`-`).

| Bit | Style | | ------- | entry_const | | Read |
`entry_const.perm_styles.read` | | Write | `entry_const.perm_styles.write` | |
Execute | `entry_const.perm_styles.execute` | | Special |
`entry_const.perm_styles.special` | | None | `entry_const.perm_styles.none` |

#### `oct` - Octal permissions

An octal permission has either three (user, group, other) or four (special, plus
the previous three) digits. <Pls /> allows customisation of each of these digits
individually.

| Digit   | Style                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Special | `entry_const.oct_styles.special` |
| User    | `entry_const.oct_styles.user`    |
| Group   | `entry_const.oct_styles.group`   |
| Other   | `entry_const.oct_styles.other`   |

#### `user`/`uid` - Owner user name/UID

<Pls /> styles the name or UID of the user that owns the node differently based
on whether the user is the current user or not. These styles apply identically
to the user name and the UID.

| User    | Style                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Current | `entry_const.user_styles.curr`  |
| Other   | `entry_const.user_styles.other` |

#### `group`/`gid` - Owner group name/GID

<Pls /> styles the name or GID of the group that owns the node differently based
on whether the current user belongs to the group or not. These styles apply
identically to the group name and the GID.

| Group   | Style                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Current | `entry_const.group_styles.curr`  |
| Other   | `entry_const.group_styles.other` |

#### `size` - Storage space

<Pls /> shows the size of the node in human readable format by default, while
allowing the user to choose between three unit systems. See
[units](/features/units/) for more information about unit systems.

You can style the three components of a size value independently. Ideally, you
want to emphasise magnitude and prefix and de-emphasise the base (which is
always "B" for bytes).

| Component | Style                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Magnitude | `entry_const.size_styles.mag`    |
| Prefix    | `entry_const.size_styles.prefix` |
| Base unit | `entry_const.size_styles.base`   |

#### `blocks` - Storage blocks

<Pls /> shows the total number of physical blocks of size 512 bytes actually
allocated on the disk for the node. This can be more than what the actual size
on disk indicates if the node has "holes".

:::note

On macOS, the minimum block size is generally 4096 bytes so any file smaller
than 4KiB will still take 8 blocks, and the number of blocks will also be a
multiple of 8.

:::

This field can by styled by specifying `entry_const.blocks_style`. <Pls /> does
not style this field by default, because a style would not add any meaning.

#### `btime`/`ctime`/`mtime`/`atime` - Timestamps

<Pls /> can display the four common timestamps of a file. <Pls /> allows you to
choose the exact format in which you prefer the timestamps to be.

| Timestamp   | Format                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Created at  | `entry_const.timestamp_formats.btime` |
| Changed at  | `entry_const.timestamp_formats.ctime` |
| Modified at | `entry_const.timestamp_formats.mtime` |
| Accessed at | `entry_const.timestamp_formats.atime` |

The timestamp can use components from the `time` crate's
[format description](https://time-rs.github.io/book/api/format-description.html#components)
freely mixed with [markup tags](/guides/markup/).

#### `git` - Git status

🚧 This feature is a work in progress and will be coming in a future version.

### Examples

Here is a custom config that approximately matches the output of
[eza](https://eza.rocks) or [exa](https://the.exa.website) at least for the
columns that they have in common with <Pls /> (<Pls /> has more, in case you
were wondering).
