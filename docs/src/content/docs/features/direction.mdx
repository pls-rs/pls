title: Direction
description:
  When using the grid view, pls can display node names either row-wise or
  column-wise based on the reading preferences of the user.

import { Content as DirectionOn } from "@/examples/direction/on.mdx";
import { Content as DirectionOff } from "@/examples/direction/off.mdx";

In the grid view, <Pls /> can position nodes in one of two ways.

- Down: <Pls /> will place nodes along a column and move on to the next column
  once the current one has been filled with a specific number of rows.

- Across: <Pls /> will place nodes along a row and move on to the next row once
  the current one has been filled with a specific number of columns.

## Arguments

`--down`/`-D` can be used to turn the downward direction on or off. It is turned
off by default because writing row-wise requires fewer steps.

:::caution

This flag has no effect unless the [grid view](/features/grid_view) is enabled
with `--grid`/`-g`.

:::

### Examples

```bash
pls --grid=true # or --down=false or -D=false
```

<DirectionOff />

```bash
pls --grid=true --down=true # or -D=true
```

<DirectionOn />
