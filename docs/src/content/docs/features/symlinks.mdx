<Pls /> can trace symlinks to their targets, and in the process identify broken
or circular symlinks. <Pls /> will also expand chains of symlinks.

## Arguments

`--sym`/`-l` can be used to turn symlink tracing on or off. It is turned on by
default but disabled in grid view due to space constraints.

:::caution

Note that symlink tracing (which can take large amounts of horizontal space) is
incompatible with the [grid view](/features/grid_view/). In case of conflict,
the grid view will be used and symlink tracing will be turned off.

Otherwise, you may disable the grid view using `--grid=false`/`-g=false`.

:::

### Examples

```console
$ pls # or --sym=true or -l=true
```

<SymlinkOn />

```console
$ pls --sym=false # or -l=false
```

<SymlinkOff />

## Configuration

Using the configuration system, you can customise the symlink styles and arrows.
Note that for valid symlinks, the style is only applied to the arrow and not the
target.

### Examples

<SymlinkConf />

<SymlinkConfd />
