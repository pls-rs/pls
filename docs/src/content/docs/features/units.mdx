import { Content as UnitsDecimal } from "@/examples/units/decimal.mdx";
import { Content as UnitsNone } from "@/examples/units/none.mdx";

<Pls /> can show the sizes of files in three unit systems.

- binary, which uses higher powers of 2 such as 2<sup>10</sup> as kibi (Ki),
  2<sup>20</sup> as mibi (Mi) etc.
- decimal, which users higher powers of 10 such as 10<sup>3</sup> as kilo (k),
  10<sup>6</sup> as mega (M) etc.
- none, which lists the exact number of bytes (B) as is.

## Arguments

`--unit`/`-u` can be used to set the unit system to use. <Pls /> uses the binary
unit system by default.

:::caution

This flag has no effect unless the [detail view](/pls/features/detail_view/)
contains the `size` field with `--det=size`/`-D=size`.

:::

### Examples

```console
$ pls --det=size # or --unit=binary or --u=binary
```

<UnitsBinary />

```console
$ pls --det=size --unit=decimal # or --u=decimal
```

<UnitsDecimal />

```console
$ pls --det=size --unit=none # or --u=binary
```

<UnitsNone />

## Configuration

Using the configuration system, you can modify the appearance of size magnitude,
prefix and base unit.

See the [detail view configuration](/pls/features/detail_view#configuration) for
an example.
