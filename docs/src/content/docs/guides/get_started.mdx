  Installing and using pls is easy and straightforward. pls can be installed via
  most package managers, downloaded as a binary, or built from source.
---

Thanks for giving <Pls /> a try. We hope you like using it as much as we do.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux:** Windows is [currently not supported](/about/faq/).
- **Terminal:** [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/),
  [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
  are great terminals that supports most <Pls /> features.
- **[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/):** Needed to render icons in the
  terminal.

:::tip

Nerd Fonts are good for more than just <Pls />. A number of CLI tools, like
[Starship](https://starship.rs/) and
[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), recommend using Nerd
Fonts.

Before picking a Nerd Font, check if your terminal app supports fallback fonts.
If it does (most do), you can choose any monospaced font you like and set
"Symbols Nerd Font" as the fallback to handle all the icons. If not, you can get
patched versions of the most popular fonts from the Nerd Fonts website.

Additionally we recommend using a font that has programming ligatures, such as
JetBrains Mono or Monaspace Neon (used in the examples on this site).

## Installation

These are the different ways you can install <Pls /> on your machine.

:::note

We are working on adding <Pls /> to more package managers like `apt` and `dnf`.
If you add <Pls /> to a package manager or repository, please let us know!

:::

### Homebrew

<Pls /> is available to install for macOS and Linux via our official [Homebrew
tap](http://github.com/pls-rs/homebrew-pls/). Currently <Pls /> is not available
through Homebrew core, but it is planned for the future.

```bash
brew install pls-rs/pls/pls
```

This command will fetch and install the latest release of <Pls /> from GitHub.

### Nix

<Pls /> is also available as a [Nix
package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=pls). You can install it using
`nix-env`, add it to your NixOS configuration or just try it using `nix-shell`.

To permanently add <Pls /> to NixOS, update your config, usually located at
`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  pkgs.pls
];
```

:::note

Thanks to [TomaSajt](https://github.com/TomaSajt) for creating this package and
to
[all its maintainers](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commits/master/pkgs/by-name/pl/pls/package.nix).

:::

:::caution

Since `nixpkgs` is a massive centralised repository, <Pls /> obtained from there
might be out of date.

### Build from source

If you have the Rust toolchain installed on your computer, you can build from
source locally for your operating system and architecture. Also, we welcome your
[contributions](/guides/contribute/)!

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/pls-rs/pls
```

You can use `--tag` to install a specific version, The current latest version is
v<Version />. Or you can use `--branch main` to get the latest, unreleased
version.

### Download binary

The CI + CD job compiles binaries for each supported OS on every code push.
Additionally, we also cut periodic releases from the `main` branch of the
repository. You can download the binary for your operating system and
architecture by following these steps.

:::tip

[Eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) downloads and extracts pre-built
binaries from releases on GitHub. <Pls /> complies with Eget's requirements so
you can replace steps 1 through 3 below with this one command.

```bash
eget --pre-release pls-rs/pls
```

:::

1. Download the binary file. You can either download the binary associated with
   a release or a commit.

   - **Release**

     1. Go to the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/pls-rs/pls/releases) page
        for <Pls />.
     2. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/pls-rs/pls/releases/latest)
        i.e. v<Version />.
     3. Expand the "Assets" attached to the release.

   - **Commit**

     1. Visit the page for <Pls />'s
        [CI + CD workflow](https://github.com/pls-rs/pls/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
     2. Click on the last successful workflow.
     3. Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section.

2. Download the binary as per your operating system.

   - `pls-x86_64-apple-darwin` for macOS
   - `pls-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for Linux

3. Unzip the archive and find the single `pls` executable.

4. Place the executable on your `$PATH`. To do this, you can either add the
   directory that contains it to the path, or move/symlink the binary to a
   directory that is already on your `$PATH`.

## Verification

You can check if <Pls /> was installed correctly and present on your `$PATH` by
running the following command. If you see a version number, you're good to go!

```bash
pls --version # or -V
```

<pre className="terminal">
  pls <Version />
</pre>

## Usage

To run <Pls />, type the following command into any terminal.

```bash
pls
```

By default, <Pls /> lists the contents of the current working directory, but you
can pass any number of different files or directories as
[positional arguments](/guides/paths).

If a directory path is passed, all the files and directories within that
directory are listed. This is useful to see what's in the folder. If a file path
is passed, only the file itself is listed. On its own, that's not very useful
except to see if that file exists. But with the
[`--det`/`-d` flag](/features/detail_view/), <Pls /> can display quite a lot of
metadata for the file.

## Help

To see what <Pls /> is capable of, and how to use those features, check out the
built-in help. You can see the detailed help or a quick reference using the
`--help`/`-h` flags respectively.

```bash
pls --help # or -h
```
